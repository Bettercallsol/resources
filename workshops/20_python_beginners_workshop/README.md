## Notes from previous workshops

This workshop was done twice so far. Initial workshop by Marie and Ines ([initial material](slides)) Some comments to take into account for future workshops:
* In the first case there was an evening for installation that included setup of github, git and github Desktop.
  [Installation party](slides/InstallationParty.pdf). Terms like repository and commit, etc where explained in that session and again in the workshop.
* In the 2nd, there was no installation party but the attendees had to install beforehand Python, Pycharm, Git and have a Github account. 
  The process to commit and the terms repository etc were introduced directly in the workshop and the attendees had to commit and push manually. Much more time and effort would be needed to properly get this working.
* In the first case the tasks where explained in detail by the tutor first, only 12 attendees and it worked pretty well.
In the 2nd the idea was to have the exercises self explained so each person could make them in their own pace. It proved to 
be pretty hard to make them very clear.  
  
### Lessons learned

* Either git and github has to be skipped from the workshop or use a separate setup session 
  and consider a GUI interface, for commit and push. Show graphically a commit to make its
  value visible.
* Installation can better work in small groups and needs many coaches. Maybe better to ask participants to pre-install
  python and oter tools and then do a pre-workshop session for git and test environments and fix issues.
* For the tasks, the instructions have to be very clearly written (will be revised soon) and they seem best to
 be explained by the tutor as well.
* Space has to be well aired and it is advised to have full break where participants go outside and walk.
* Doing the workshop with many people is challenging, a microphone might be needed and should be properly tested
  and also prepare for very big fonts in the IDE/console.
* Many friendly and floating coaches made it possible to scale the workshop to many participants 40+, with 
  really great results!
