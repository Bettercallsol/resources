# Workshop Data wrangling with Pandas

It is a very interactive workshop that has a lot action and fun! I can be reused with new cards for many different topics.

1. Attendees were given [these cards](Pandas.odp) to choose some of them
2. Then they would have to look up these pandas methods for 10 -15 minutes
3. Then they would have to find somebody to explain their cards and exchange them.

You can also find here the [template of the cards](Templates.odp) to create your own.
