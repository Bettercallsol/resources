## Email account management

add a label with your name when you are responsible to follow up on an email
There are a couple with the label unassigned that are for conference partnerships. Feel free to reply and follow up if you think this is a fair a good offer for our community and it is worth advertising their conference (eg. if it is only 20% and not even a free ticket, might not be worth it). 
We eventually will need to send some tweets for that event. Jessica can do that when needed, if the text is ready, they provide the hashtags or mentions they wish to have included it is easier. 
They might ask for our logos
