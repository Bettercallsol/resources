For guidelines on how for our social media accounts you can check out our documentation [here](./social_media.md).

## Google group

The google group is used to be able to share files and calendar invites. To get access please send an email to [berlin@pyladies.com](mailto:berlin@pladies.com)

## Lastpass

We are currently using Lastpass premium family (due to expire in Sept 2023) this allows us to share full folders with "family members", the number of members allowed is limited but individual passwords can be shared also. The most active members will be given access to the shared folder and other members can request for certain passwords to be shared with them.

## 2FA

For some of our accounts we have 2FA set up, this offers an additional layer of security but poses a problem of shared authentication. To get around this we have set up a phone number with Telynx that can be used for 2FA and sends messages to the slack channel #2fa-open

## Email account management

- Add a label with your name when you are responsible to follow up on an email
- If you read an email but don't intend to respond, please mark it unread so it does not get missed
