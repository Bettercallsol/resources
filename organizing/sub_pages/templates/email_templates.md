## Job Posting Emails

Hi {POSITION_ADVERTISER}, 

It is great to see companies interested to increase diversity. In that direction, I would strongly recommend to also look into achieving inclusion that can sustain diversity. We suggest Elizabeth Black's short article [1] regarding writing inclusive job descriptions.

If you'd like, you're welcome to share your job posts in our slack [2] in the channel #jobs. We recommend that you explicitly mention what makes the working environment inclusive.

Best wishes,

## Speaker Emails

### Email #01

**:white_check_mark: To be sent 5 weeks before the meetup**

Hi there, speakers! :smile:

We are so excited to have you speak at our {MONTH} event! :heart_eyes:

I'm {PYLADY}, I am organizing the event and will be your point of contact.

I will be publishing the meetup page soon and announcing the event on our social media. For that, I need a short summary of what you will present and a bio.

Below is an example:

*Maria Jose Molina-Contreras - I am sorry Academia, it’s you, not me.*

*In this talk, I would like to share my experiences while changing my career path
from academia to data science in the industry. It was, and still is, an emotional
rollercoaster, but don’t worry! I will give you some tips to keep your motivation up,
technical advises, and useful resources to not dying while trying.*

*Maria Jose is a tech enthusiast, that after a couple of dates with Python, decided
to start a formal relationship. She got a PhD in Biotechnology (Plants molecular
biology) in Barcelona before moving to Berlin. Currently, she is working at ZAGENO
as Data analyst.*

I wanted to take the opportunity to share this [speaker guide](speakers-guide.md) with you, it covers both workshop & speaking events, so not everything will be applicable, please share with us any questions you may have :smile:

Let me know if I can already be of assistance. :ribbon:

Greetings,

### Email #02

**:white_check_mark: To be sent 4 weeks before the meetup**

Hello everybody,

I hope you are getting on well with your preparation, don't forget to let me know if I can help you. :ribbon:

We want to support our speakers as much as we can and therefore offer help with slides, talk topics, and doing a dry run before the event. These are all optional but I recommend taking advantage of it. Everyone also approaches these things differently, so it is open to you to let us know how we can best support you.

I would recommend arranging a dry run through latest the week before and we can make ourselves available before that remotely.

Let me know what you think works best for you and if you want to discuss any of the above I am happy to schedule a call :smile:

Best wishes,
{PYLADY} & the Berlin PyLadies :woman_technologist::snake:
