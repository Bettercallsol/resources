## :clipboard: Event organizing

### Finding host
We have many hosts reaching out to us by email. We are contacting them 2-3 months before the event to book the date. We also have a list of past hosts in Trello when we need to ask explicitly. Reach out to them with the [Host initial email](host.md).

### :microphone: Finding speakers
We usually ask women in person to give talks and also have some that reach out to us by email. Check with Trello if we have potential speakers or check with other organizers if there were some unrecorded discussions.

### :mega: Announce event (One month before)
When host and speakers are found, or even if still some are pending, it is time to announce the event.
