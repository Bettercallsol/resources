Hi {POSITION_ADVERTISER}, 

It is great to see companies interested to increase diversity. In that direction, I would strongly recommend to also look into achieving inclusion that can sustain diversity. We suggest Elizabeth Black's short article [1] regarding writing inclusive job descriptions.

If you'd like, you're welcome to share your job posts in our slack [2] in the channel #jobs. We recommend that you explicitly mention what makes the working environment inclusive.

Best wishes,
