Company speaker(s):

We normally reserve 5-10 minutes slot after our introduction for a host presentation. In any case please forward the code of conduct to speakers involved and also some tips for the presentation:
   - Audience level may vary significantly.
   - Assume no prior knowledge but infinite intelligence.
   - Consider folks instead of guys.
   - We  know it can be hard especially for an expert to present something to an audience without prior knowledge, so we would like to offer to give feedback on slides or support the speaker if they have any questions.
Let us know what are your plan in this regard of if you would like more time to check if it is possible.
